# Wiki
  This app is built to experiment with more associations.

  Also a recipe will have and belong to many users.

  This model represents something kind of like a wiki site.
  People can edit any article, and their name will be added to the list.

  I had some difficulty with devise on this one... Something was keeping
  my new user data from saving so I was only able to sign up instead of
  sign in.  Seeing as this app was designed to just test these associations
  I decided it would be best to move on after I got the basic tests to pass.
